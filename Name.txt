ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA

RATINGS:
IMDB: 8.1/10		ROTTEN TOMATOES: 91%				

PLOT: Kabir, a part of a family construction business, proposes to his girlfriend Natasha. Their families meet at the engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends – Imran, an advertisement copywriter; and Arjun, a financial broker who is working in London. Kabir says the three friends have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip each of them will pick an adventure sport that all three will try together. 

CAST:Initially, the producers wanted Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor to play two of the three leads, but they declined without specifying a reason. 
Farhan Akhtar had worked with Zoya on her debut film Luck by Chance and also wrote dialogue for the film; Zoya felt he would know exactly what she wanted from the film.
He was the first actor to be cast in the film.
Farhan Akhtar defined his role as a "fun character" and a "guy who for the longest time takes nothing seriously".
Hrithik Roshan was chosen for another lead role because he was one of Zoya's favourite actors.
After finalising the two, she needed someone "who could not just fit in with them visually but also bring something new to the table." 
She sought Abhay Deol for the role, as he was her friend and had worked with her before in Kagti's Honeymoon Travels Pvt.
For the role of Laila, Zoya wanted someone with an accent who would be willing to scuba dive,[24] and was a half-Indian and half-Caucasian woman. A lot of women were auditioned for the part in New York and London. Later, at a party, Zoya met Katrina Kaif and chose her for the role.[14] Her role was described as "a free- spirited girl, a wanderer at heart and a bohemian gypsy by nature".[19] Zoya had wanted to work with Kalki Koechlin ever since seeing her in Dev.D and That Girl in Yellow Boots; she felt Koechlin would suit the character of Natasha because she had "the sense of comedy, but not over the top".[25] Spanish actress Ariadna Cabrol was chosen for the role of Nuria because Zoya liked her work in the 2009 Spanish film Eloïse's Lover.RELEASE DATE: 13 October 2016 (Hong Kong)
